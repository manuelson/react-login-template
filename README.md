# React Login Template

This document describes a login template in React that connects to a custom API to authenticate users.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- src/
	- components/
		- LoginForm.js: This component handles the login form.
		- LogoutButton.js: This component handles the logout functionality.
	- api/
		- auth.js: This module connects to the custom API to handle authentication requests.
	- contexts/
		- AuthContext.js: This module provides the authentication context for the application.
	- App.js: This is the main component of the application.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled through AuthContext.js and auth.js. AuthContext.js provides a context that contains the user state and functions to log in and log out. auth.js connects to the custom API to authenticate the user.

## Login

Login is handled through the LoginForm.js component. When the user submits the login form, LoginForm.js calls the login function provided by AuthContext.js.

## Logout

Logout is handled through the LogoutButton.js component. When the user clicks the logout button, LogoutButton.js calls the logout function provided by AuthContext.js.

## Connecting to the Custom API

The connection to the custom API is handled through auth.js. auth.js uses fetch to send authentication requests to the API and returns the API's responses.

## Usage

To use this template, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies with npm install or yarn install, and then start the application with npm start or yarn start. Be sure to configure the URL of your custom API in auth.js.

## Conclusion

This template provides a solid base for creating a React application with authentication. With a bit of customization, you can adapt it to your own needs and connect it to your own API.
